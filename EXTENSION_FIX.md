# 🔧 Extension Loading Error - FIXED!

## ✅ **Issue Resolved**

The extension loading error has been fixed! The problem was that the `platform-icons.js` file was not being copied to the dist folder during the build process.

## 🐛 **What Was Wrong**

### **Missing File:**
- `platform-icons.js` was not being copied to `dist/icons/`
- `popup.html` was trying to load `src/icons/platform-icons.js` 
- This caused the extension to fail loading

### **Path Issues:**
- Incorrect script path in popup.html
- Missing file in build process

## ✅ **What Was Fixed**

### **1. Updated Build Script:**
- Added copying of `platform-icons.js` to `dist/icons/`
- Improved PNG icon generation
- Fixed file paths

### **2. Fixed popup.html:**
- Changed script path from `src/icons/platform-icons.js` to `icons/platform-icons.js`
- Removed `type="module"` from popup.js script tag

### **3. Proper File Structure:**
```
dist/
├── background.js ✅
├── popup.html ✅
├── popup.js ✅
├── manifest.json ✅
├── icons/
│   ├── platform-icons.js ✅ (NOW INCLUDED)
