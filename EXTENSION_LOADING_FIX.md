- **After**: Minimal background script with just essential functionality
- **Result**: Eliminates potential API compatibility issues

### **File Structure Verified:**
```
dist/
├── background-simple.js ✅ (Minimal, working)
├── background.js ✅ (Full version, if needed)

```

### **Manifest Configuration:**

1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Click **"Clear all"** (if available)
3. Restart Chrome

## 🐛 **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **"Service Worker Inactive" Error:**
- **Solution**: This is normal for Manifest V3

### **"Failed to Load Extension" Error:**
